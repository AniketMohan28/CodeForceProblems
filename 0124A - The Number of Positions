Problem: The Number of Positions
Problem Statement:

Petr stands in a line of n people, but he isn't sure about his exact position. However, he knows that there are at least a people standing in front of him and at most b people standing behind him. Your task is to determine the number of possible positions Petr could occupy in the line.

Input:

The input consists of a single line containing three integers: n, a, and b where 0 ≤ a, b < n ≤ 100.
Output:

Print a single integer representing the number of possible positions Petr could occupy in the line.
