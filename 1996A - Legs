**Time Limit:** 2 seconds
**Memory Limit:** 256 megabytes

It's another beautiful day on Farmer John's farm.

After Farmer John arrived at his farm, he counted `n` legs. It is known only chickens and cows live on the farm, and a chicken has 2 legs while a cow has 4.

What is the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm assuming he counted the legs of all animals?

**Input**
The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, n is even).

**Output**
For each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm
