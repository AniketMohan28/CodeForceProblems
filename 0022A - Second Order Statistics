/* A. Second Order Statistics
   Time limit per test: 2 seconds
   Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
   Once Bob needed to find the second order statistics of a sequence of integer numbers.
   Let's choose each number from the sequence exactly once and sort them. The value on the second position is the second order statistics of the given sequence.
   In other words, it is the smallest element strictly greater than the minimum. Help Bob solve this problem.

   Input
   The first input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the amount of numbers in the sequence.
   The second line contains n space-separated integer numbers — elements of the sequence. These numbers don't exceed 100 in absolute value.

   Output
   If the given sequence has the second order statistics, output this order statistics; otherwise, output NO.
