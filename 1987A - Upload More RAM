/* A. Upload More RAM
   Time Limit per Test: 1 second
   Memory Limit per Test: 256 megabytes

   Oh no, the ForceCodes servers are running out of memory! Luckily, you can help them out by uploading some of your RAM!

   You want to upload n GBs of RAM. Every second, you can upload either 0 or 1 GB of RAM. However, there is a restriction on your network speed: 
   in any k consecutive seconds, you can upload only at most 1 GB of RAM in total.

   Find the minimum number of seconds needed to upload n GBs of RAM!

   Input:
   Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. 
   The description of the test cases follows.

   The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of GBs that you want to upload and the length of the time window respectively.

   Output:
   For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of seconds needed to upload n GBs of RAM.
