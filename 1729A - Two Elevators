A. Two Elevators
================
**Time Limit:** 1 second per test  
**Memory Limit:** 256 megabytes  

Vlad is on the 1st floor of his apartment building and wants to call an elevator to go up to his apartment.

There are two elevators in his building:

1. The first elevator is currently on floor `a` (it is stationary).
2. The second elevator is located on floor `b` and is moving to floor `c` (where `b ≠ c`).

- If `b = 1`, the second elevator is already leaving the 1st floor, so Vlad cannot enter it in time.
- If Vlad calls the first elevator, it will immediately start moving to the 1st floor.
- If Vlad calls the second elevator, it will first go to floor `c` and then move to the 1st floor.
- It takes |x − y| seconds for an elevator to move from floor `x` to floor `y`.

**Objective:**  
Help Vlad choose the elevator that will arrive faster.

### Input
- The first line contains the integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.
- The next `t` lines contain three integers each: `a`, `b`, and `c` (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^8, b ≠ c) — the floor numbers described above.

### Output
- For each test case, output:
  1. `1`, if the first elevator will arrive faster;
  2. `2`, if the second elevator will arrive faster;
  3. `3`, if both elevators will arrive at the same time.
