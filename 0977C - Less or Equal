/* 
C. Less or Equal

Time limit per test: 2 seconds
Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
You are given a sequence of integers of length n and an integer number k. 
You need to find and print any integer number x within the range [1, 10^9] 
(i.e., 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) such that exactly k elements of the given sequence are 
less than or equal to x.

Note that the sequence can contain equal elements.

If no such x exists, print "-1" (without quotes).

Input:
- The first line of input contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n).
- The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) — the sequence itself.

Output:
- Print any integer number x from the range [1, 10^9] such that exactly k elements 
  of the given sequence are less than or equal to x.
- If there is no such x, print "-1" (without quotes).

Example:
Input:
5 3
2 8 5 7 7

Output:
7

Explanation:
The sorted sequence is [2, 5, 7, 7, 8]. The 3rd element in this sequence is 7, 
and there are exactly 3 elements (2, 5, 7) that are less than or equal to 7.
