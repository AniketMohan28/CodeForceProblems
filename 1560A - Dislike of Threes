A. Dislike of Threes
Time limit per test: 1 second
Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by 3 or end with the digit 3 in their decimal representation. Integers that meet either or both conditions are disliked by Polycarp.

Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 0) integers which he likes: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, … Output the k-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 1).

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
Then t test cases follow.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000).

Output
For each test case, output in a separate line one integer x — the k-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.
